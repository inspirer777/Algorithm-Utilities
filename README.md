# Algorithm Utilities

This repository provides a set of fundamental algorithms and utilities in Python. It includes implementations for sorting, searching, graph manipulation, and more.

## Features
- **Binary Search**: Efficiently search for an element in a sorted array.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Includes `Selection Sort` and `Bubble Sort` with step-by-step printing.
- **Expression Conversion**: Convert infix expressions to prefix and postfix notation.
- **Graph Operations**:
  - Build a graph from an adjacency matrix.
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal of a graph.
- **Heap Construction**: Create min-heap or max-heap from an array.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or later
- Required libraries (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - `networkx`
  - `matplotlib`

## Usage
Run the main program to access a menu interface for algorithm demos:
```bash
python algorithm_utilities.py
```
